FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT CHANGI AIRPORT EARLY CHECK-IN
At Changi Airport, passengers have the option to check in early for added convenience. Early check-in allows travellers to drop off their baggage and receive their boarding passes ahead of their scheduled departure, starting from 3 to 24 hours before the flight. This service is particularly beneficial for those who want to explore the airport’s amenities or simply avoid the last-minute rush. Unlike regular check-in, which opens about 2 to 3 hours before departure, early check-in provides more flexibility and reduces time spent in queues.
Most airlines operating out of Changi Airport offer the option to check in online, allowing passengers to select their seats and print their boarding passes from the convenience of their home or office. However, there are exceptions, and some smaller or charter airlines might not provide this service. Passengers are advised to check with their respective airlines directly for specific online check-in availability.
To complete online check-in for flights departing from Changi Airport, passengers will need their booking reference or ticket number and the passport details of all travellers. Some airlines may also require travellers to enter visa details or other travel documentation depending on their destination. It’s important to have all necessary documents handy at the time of online check-in to ensure a smooth process.
When checking in online, passengers with special needs or additional requests can manage these preferences through the airline’s website. Most airline interfaces offer options to add extra baggage, request assistance at the airport, or make other necessary arrangements. If specific needs aren’t addressed on the online check-in platform, passengers should contact the airline directly to ensure all accommodations are in place before arriving at the airport.
If passengers encounter any difficulties during the online check-in process, it's important to address the issue promptly to ensure a smooth and stress-free journey. Here are the steps you should follow:

The luggage drop-off service at both locations is typically available from 12 to 24 hours before the flight’s departure, but hours may vary depending on the airline and terminal

Once inside, you will be able to enjoy amenities including comfortable seating, snooze areas and light entertainment while waiting for your flight.

Yes, you will be allowed to bring your purchase from the other airports if the items are packed in a Sealed Tamper Evident Bag (STEB) with the receipt clearly displayed in the STEB. The receipt must show the date of purchase, item(s) purchased, the shop name and the airport name. However, this only applies to passengers who will be traveling on flights that are not bound for the EU, Australia and U.S.A.
For more information, please click here.
For flights bound for Australia or U.S.A., only duty-free LAGs (sold by duty free shops) purchased at the last port that are gate-delivered to the aircraft will be allowed to be carried on board the aircraft. Essentially, if you are departing from Singapore or transiting in Singapore to Australia or U.S.A., LAGs merchandises which are not purchased at Changi Airport and are not gate-delivered to the aircraft would be sieved out either by the Airline staff or Auxiliary Police Officers appointed by the Airlines at pre-board screening. You would be asked to discard the items before you are allowed to board the aircraft.
Australia and U.S. security checkpoints do not recognize the use of Security Temper Evident Bag (STEB). Hence, passengers with connecting flights after arrival to Australia and U.S.A. will be required to discard the items if the following measures are not taken:
a) If you are transiting via an Australian airport to another Australian destination or non-Australian destination, you are advised to purchase your LAGs item only at the last port before your final destination.
b) Similarly, if you are transiting via a U.S.A. airport to another U.S.A. or non-U.S.A. destination, you will have the opportunity to reclaim your check-in luggage before passing through U.S.A. customs, and your LAGs purchase must be placed in your check-in luggage prior to checking in for your connecting flight.
